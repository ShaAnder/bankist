## Introduction

Next up on the project showcase is another variation of Bankist, originally found on [Udemy, The Javascript Complete Course by Jonas Scmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) this time we're working on an example front end website for the fictional app, that has form submission for user logins and account creation as well aas showcases some skills picked up learning advanced dom manipulation.

### Why This?

This is the third major project from the Javascript complete course I am attending, with a large focus on working with the DOM, manipulation, traversing and delegation.

## Project Brief

### In Depth Description

On the indepth side this project utilizes dom manipulation to primarily effect how the page looks and works, we use javascripts in built methods as well as a lot of event handling and delegation to make neat compact and clean looking website components

### Working Breakdown

At it's core, as said above, it's designed with one thing, dom manipulation, in mind. Most of the tabbed components utilize something like a hidden class to hide parts that are not in use, and when we click on buttons or sliders it removes said class or changes said element in some way to display it.

For example with the tabbed components we use hidden classes to ensure only one is displayed at a time

Whereas with the testimonails we actually put a 100% pad in between them and then effectively move the slides on and off the screen to create the sliding effect

It's at its core a lot of dom trickery at wrk

#### FUNCTIONALITY

The website has some functionality baked into it, while it's primarily all techniques for loading (lazy loading images) or just clean scrolling and button navigation, there also is a create account modal window popup that we shall be using for the next iteration of this project.

## Learning Points & Takeaway

This project was a great example of dom manipulation works and it's going to be interesting building a backend for it too!
